**occupation** freelance writer:
discovery --- value(real value, not income) highly depend on how professional you are.
//[More clear about aim]What I want is "to provide insight to public", so the right approach seems to be ordinary(e.g. research). But I'm slightly different from old myself and current others now because I consider something important to me: for example seeking truth and sticking to problem, rather than earning maximum money without any evaluation of it's moral consequence.
//[More clear about an occupation] Income of freelance writer in China per article can be as less as 20$/k words, so a short article like 4k words can be as less as 80$. The income level of this market looks similar to freelancer coder which get 50-100$ for a small project.

**HUGE choice** political science master/phd:
discovery --- Compared to a undergraduate students of econ/pol, I have deep view about things(to be specifically? society of a country?) and these views are based on extreme observation(i.e. unlimited in mind) of people/society of where I live. 
Furthermore, compared to scholars, I may even have un-biased opinions as I have no pressure of reputy loss, for example, I'm quite tolerate to the opponents of the famous people in weibo during the heated discussion.
Also, a short reason --- I'm older than the undergraduate.

//[More clear about my foundation] I already have criteria of what is a valueable research(can be discussed in detail later) and what is more fundamental --- certain degrees of independent thinking.
