//question about the document: what to find in my heart? then what to analyze to make that clear?

**occupation** freelance writer:
discovery --- value(real value, not income) highly depend on how professional you are.
//[More clear about aim]What I want is "to provide insight to public", so the right approach seems to be ordinary(e.g. research). But I'm slightly different from old myself and current others now because I consider something important to me: for example seeking truth and sticking to problem, rather than earning maximum money without any evaluation of it's moral consequence.
//[More clear about an occupation] Income of freelance writer in China per article can be as less as 20$/k words, so a short article like 4k words can be as less as 80$. The income level of this market looks similar to freelancer coder which get 50-100$ for a small project.

**analysis of HUGE choice** political science master/phd:
discovery --- Compared to a undergraduate students of econ/pol, I have deep view about things(to be specifically? society of a country?) and these views are based on extreme observation(i.e. unlimited in mind) of people/society of where I live. 
Furthermore, compared to scholars, I may even have un-biased opinions as I have no pressure of reputy loss, for example, I'm quite tolerate to the opponents of the famous people in weibo during the heated discussion.
Also, a short reason --- I'm older than the undergraduate.

//[More clear about my foundation] I already have criteria of what is a valueable research(can be discussed in detail later) and what is more fundamental --- certain degrees of independent thinking.

**analysis of HUGE choice** econ master/phd: (note that he's also in applied math and title is "econ theorist", and in micro theory)
discovery --- 1. as clear or even clearer than him about what is a valuable research(see what his favorite links are about), or what he is doing seems no use or interesting to himself because his seraching seems to indicate that he is finding some direction/important point, in a word truth about economics, and he looks at physics which is more related to the math part, emm, yes he is on the theory part, so maybe it is common in this field, but is it natural that econ too far away from reality? or is the approach of first math then model/econ natural, which may resembles the ISDN development(a solution looking for problems); 2. "Data science" and "ruby programming" is also closely related to econ practically!

**HUGE question of heart**
you really need to do research/excercies of research to get what you want?

**HUGE question of practice**
is it moral to do research for long abroad now?
is it possible to do "real" research for long abroad now?
